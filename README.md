## Abiding by the theme

## Running the project
The project is setup in such a way that you can run it using bunch of repl's.

### Discord bot 
- Make a new python repl and add all the files in discord folder to that repl. Please note that repl doesn't allow us to delete or rename main file so you have to update it by copying the code from main file in discord folder and pasting it in main file of your repl

### Node.js

### Golang

### Python flask

## Rube goldberg implementation
- Repl for discord bot will only do discord specific functions 
- Node.js repl will check if input is valid or no
- Golang repl will make any api calls 
- Python flask will do game specific functions
